    You're on a path in the—</p>

    Shit! Shit! What— what the hell was that?! Who are we? What are we doing?!</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Broken</div>
    There was a Princess, I think. It's all so fuzzy. It hurts when I try to remember.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    You shouldn't know about the Princess. At least not until I... You've already been here, haven't you?</p>

    <div class="name"><div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div></div>
    I guess? It feels so long ago. Almost like we've never left.</p>

    <div class="name"><div class="name">Voice of the Broken</div></div>
    We have to let her out.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    No, that's the opposite of what you're here to do. You have to Slay her.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Paranoid</div>
    Slay... we decided not to do that, didn't we?</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Opportunist</div>
    Yeah, we're supposed to let her out. It's really the only way this works out for us, if you think about it. She's the one with power here. Nobody else can do much of anything.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Stubborn</div>
    No, we were supposed to keep her trapped there forever... I think.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cold</div>
    We're supposed to be unfeeling. How many times do I have to tell you to snuff out your heart?</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hunted</div>
    We can't be unfeeling. Not when there's so much fear everywhere.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Contrarian</div>
    There's nothing for us to do. We've already tried everything.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Smitten</div>
    We love her. So we have to set her free.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Skeptic</div>
    Can we love something that hates us? Can we love something that hurts us?</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Smitten</div>
    To be given an ounce of kindness from something so cruel would be more pure than any other love.</p>

    Stay focused. You still have a job to do, and it's best not to be distracted by fraying thoughts. There is no mirror. You know that as well as I do.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hunted</div>
    She's still here. Buried deep inside the earth.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cold</div>
    Just walk up the hill. You always give too much space to the others. It's why you always lose.</p>

    They've been heard too much. It's why they are the way they are.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Exactly. They are delusions, and all that catering to them will do is drag you down to their level. You have to keep moving.</p>

    You walk up the hill, hesitating just beyond the bounds of 'the cabin.'</p>

    The cabin that isn't there.</p>

    You've got to clean the mirror, haven't you? You've got to see what's in it.</p>

    Smash it to pieces.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Broken</div>
    She's on the other side, and we have to let her out. It's the only way we can be free.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Paranoid</div>
    It's the only way we can have our thoughts back.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Contrarian</div>

    Of course it'll work. He always makes the best decisions. It's why he gets to make them!</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cold</div>
    And it already has worked. It's gone, don't you see?</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Broken</div>
    We're one step closer to her.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    The interior of 'the cabin' is much the same as the exterior of 'the cabin', a dull, fuzzy, dreamlike nothing. It's empty and isolating, but there's just enough vague shape and unknown texture to suggest the structure therein, wrong and unsettling as it may be.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    The only object of note is a pristine blade buried in the dirt floor, a hint of its shining edge teasing through the sediment.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    The blade is your implement. You'll need it if you're going to do this right.</p>

    You reach down to take the blade, but as you do, the ground beneath it shifts, the weapon sinking deep into the earth.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    You lean over the hole and gaze into the abyss. It is so very deep.</p>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Deep in the vowels of the earth, you see something staring back at you. It fills you with dread.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    It's her.</p>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Paranoid</div>
    She's watching us. She never stops watching us.</p>

    <span class="princess_darkpink">You really are a coward!</span></p>

    <span class="princess_darkpink">I was joking when I said that way back when. You know that, right?</span></p>

    You extend your hand to hers. For all her past cruelties, the moment feels gentle, tender even. I can't believe you just made me say that. I hate you.</p>

    The motion is difficult at first, as if something still resists your efforts, but then that resistance gives way, and it's over.</p>
