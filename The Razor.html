    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Those are two very different questions, but fine. I'll indulge you if that's what it takes to get you moving.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Let's say for a moment that this really is the second time you've met me, or, at least, a version of me.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    If you're back here, I'm assuming you died, which probably only happened because you didn't listen to me. 

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    We did exactly what you said.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Sounds to me like you probably had some kind of elaborate nightmare, in which case I shouldn't be held accountable for what supposedly happened.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    But congratulations. You've been given a chance to actually do this right.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    And I believe your other questions was something along the lines of 'what's the point of doing anything?' If you're asking that, it sound to me like you're making the rather dangerous assumption that your actions last time around didn't have any consequences.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    What do you mean? Of course there weren't any consequences.
    We were killed by the Princess, and now everyone's right back where they started. That sounds pretty consequence-free to me.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Yes, but, in this purely hypothetical scenario, that begs the question of <i>how</i> you got back here. Did 'time' simply rewind itself, or were you instead transported to a different world entirely?

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    If it's the latter, what do you think happened <i>after</i> you died?

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Do you think the people there lived happily ever after, or do you think that the Princess, left unhindered, brought about the end to everyone and everything, just like I told you she would?

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    Screw this. Who cares what happened to everyone else? She's not going to play fair, so we should do what we can to save ourselves and just <i>get out of here</i>.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    At least you know not to trust her, but you do realize that 'everything and everyone' includes you, right? If you turn around and leave, you're dooming yourself as well as everyone else.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    She just caught us by surpise last time. She can't do that twice. So long as we're careful, we can win this.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    That's the spirit. Just keep that stiff upper lip and you'll save the world in no time at all.

    The door to the basement creaks open, revealing what must once have been stairs. The fractured slats look as if they've been torn from their source and violently jammed into the wall.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    The air seeping up from below has an almost metallic quality to it. Like the smell of fresh blood. And you can hear what sounds like the rhythmic scraping of metal coming from down below. If the Princess lives here, slaying her would probably be doing her a favor.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    That's right, <i>scraping</i>. I told you she has something. I <i>told</i> you.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    That sound could be anything. It's probably just her chains dragging across the floor. I am begging you to get out of your head.

    Yeah, she thinks she's better than us. Like she doesn't even have to put on an act this time.

    As you descend the final step, the form of the Princess comes into view, her sharp eyes following you from across the room.

    I wonder if she remembers us.

    <span class="princess_darkpink">Finally, <i>somebody</i>! Quick, get me out of these chains, we're not safe here.</span>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    Come on, now. We're not falling for that, are we? She's trying to trick us, but she can't hide that threatening edge to her voice. She just wants us to get close, to let our guard down.

    Exactly. She sounds threatening because her mask is already slipping. She know why you're here.

    I have absolutely zero doubts that she is going to stab us if we get close to her.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    She certainly feels threatening.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Just because she is acting like she's going to stab you doesn't mean she has the means to actually do it.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    But you know who has the capacity to quickly arm himself? You do. So stop second guessing yourself, go upstairs, take the blade, and do your job.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    But I'm nervous.

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">All sorts of things, which is why I think that's a great idea! I would love to not be chained up down here. Being chained up is so boring and I crave fresh and new activities to broaden my horizons.</span>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Please don't let her out of here.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    Believe it or not, I think I'm actually with Him on this.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    Okay, but what if all of this is just a misunderstanding? There has to be room for this to be a misunderstanding.

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">Of course I won't!</span>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Against your better judgement, you walk across the room to within arm's reach of the Princess.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    I don't like the way you said 'within arm's reach.'

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    You hear the horrible sound of metal slicing through meat.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    Whose meat? Not ours, right?

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Hers at first.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Then yours. Your neck, specifically.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    Again? Really?

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">Hehe!</span>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    You collapse to the ground, your vision swimming as you attempt to focus on her bloody blade and the limp sack of flesh that was once her arm.

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">You're going to die now.</span>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    And with a quick jerk of her elbow, she does just that. Everything goes dark, and you die.

    [NO WAY OUT]

    [BORED]

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">Okay, I'm bored now.</span>

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    She's bored...?

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    That's absurd. She doesn't get to be bored. Not in a way that matters. She's a prisoner. She's—

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Shit. In a sudden burst of movement, the Princess leaps towards you, a blade erupting from her free arm, her wrist limp and empty from the violent expulsion. Huh. So I guess she did have a knife of her own after all.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    How conciliatory of you. We appreciate it, really. Now what are we going to do?

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    At least we're safe here. She's still in chains.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    And those chains stop her from continuing her advance, at least for a moment.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    She looks down at them with something between annoyance and confusion.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    And then she slices through her arm.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    Okay. Maybe we aren't safe here.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    She doesn't even hesitate before darting towards you with a terrifying speed you can't hope to outpace.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Cheated</div>
    That won't stop us from trying. Run run run run!

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    You sprint for the stairs, but I wasn't exaggerating when I said she was running at you with a terrifying speed you couldn't hope to outpace.

    <div class="name">Voice of the Hero</div>
    We don't make it, do we?

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    No. You feel her blade in your back before you make it to the first stair.

    The Princess
    <span class="princess_darkpink">I'm going to kill you now.</span>

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    And with a squelch, she does just that.

    <div class="name">The Narrator</div>
    Everything goes dark, and you die.
